#+TITLE: ROADMAP

* Next steps [50%]

- [-] Improved conversions
  - [ ] Cancellable conversions for those that haven't started yet (minor UI redesign needed?)
  - [X] Custom output location for individual documents in the conversion queue
  - [X] Support for password-protected documents
- [-] User Interface
  - [ ] There are probably too many redraw operations in the Desktop UI
  - [ ] Sorting in the conversion queue (file name, status, etc.)
  - [ ] Allow other operations during conversions (add more files, etc.)
  - [ ] Add overall progress information during conversions (pie chart?)
  - [X] Hide command prompts while running processes on Windows, and address file permissions errors
  - [X] Responsiveness issues during conversions (UI thread and background operations)
  - [X] Display overall conversion results ("X out of Y files were not successfully converted")
  - [X] Prompt for confirmation prior closing the application during conversions (Desktop only)
  - [X] Manual check for release updates (Desktop and command-line clients)  
- [X] Container solutions and hardening
  - [X] Review container execution options (subject of recurring reviews)
  - [X] Review some of the code and read few security-related articles (subject of recurring reviews)
- [-] Code maintenance
  - [ ] Add automated tests (unit & integration)
  - [X] Migrate from [[https://actix.rs/][actix_web]] to [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum][axum]] for the =entrusted_webserver= component
  - [X] Eliminate shell commands inside the container image
- [X] CI/CD and packaging
  - [X] Adopt Git flow and delete all the previous spiral branches
  - [X] Create few specific packages (DEB, RPM)
  - [X] Add README notes for [[https://github.com/axtloss/flatpaks][axtloss Flatpak packages]] and later in release notes
  - [X] Support for different [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][aarch64/arm64]]
  - [X] For now, stick to custom CI/CD pipeline instead of [[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub actions]] or similar
- [X] Mime-type detection and file associations
  - [X] Register file associations with supported document types
  - [X] For now, roll custom mime-type detection system until there is something better available

* Initial plan [100%]

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (Open Document, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
- [X] UI and other improvements, including tech debt and other issues
- [X] Bring back Office document support via LibreOffice
  - [X] Add workarounds for mime-type detection library (Open Document, OOXML, Legacy office format)
  - [X] Update processing logic to use LibreOffice for initial PDF conversion, prior further processing
- [X] Documentation updates and compilation error fix
- [X] Usability improvements and slightly better MS Windows support
- [X] Online service with Web interface and remote CLI client
- [X] Look at releases for Linux, Mac OS and Windows
- [X] Documentation updates
- [X] Implement conversion progress information
- [X] Minimal CI/CD pipeline
- [X] Provide live CD
- [X] Initial support for batch conversions
  - [X] In the Web user interface
  - [X] In the graphical desktop interface
  - [X] Document a simple =find-exec= workflow for the command-line client
- [X] Fix few obvious issues and then release new batch conversion feature
  - [X] Do not ship an unsigned app bundle for Mac OS as it doesn't behave/work anyway
  - [X] Mitigate some of the new Desktop and Web UI bugs as much as possible
- [X] Additional release artifacts for convenience
  - [X] Add DMG image for Mac OS, with the ability to still invoke external programs
  - [X] Add software installer for Windows via [[https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page][NSIS]] for now
- [X] Support application preferences
- [X] Add infrastructure for message translations: English and French for now
- [X] Minor code cleanup, create artwork and rename the Github project
