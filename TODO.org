#+TITLE: ROADMAP

* Next steps

- [-] Improved conversions
  - [X] Custom output location for individual documents in the conversion queue
  - [X] Support for password-protected documents
  - [ ] Cancellable conversions for those that haven't started yet (minor UI redesign needed)
  - [ ] Parallel conversions
  - [ ] Minimal resources management to avoid exhausting computer CPU and memory
- [ ] Investigate if specific support is required for Tails Linux (proxy, etc.)
- User Interface
  - [ ] There're probably too many redraw operations in the Desktop UI
  - [ ] Improve scrolling behavior during conversions ("smooth-scrolling")
- [-] Code maintenance
  - [X] Eliminate shell commands inside the container image
  - [ ] Add automated tests (unit & integration
- [ ] Hardening
  - [ ] Review container execution options (podman v.s podman-remote, security options, etc.)
  - [ ] Revisit Flatpak support requirements and =flatpak-spawn=
  - [ ] Review some of the code and read few security-related articles
- [ ] Online Web Service
  - [ ] Evaluate [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum][axum]] as a replacement of [[https://github.com/actix/actix-web][actix_web]] ([[https://ordina-jworks.github.io/event-driven/2021/04/23/SSE-with-HTTP2.html#http11-vs-http2][HTTP2 support + SSE]] + browsers)
  - [ ] Use the =Content-Language= header in response (translations)
- [-] CI/CD
  - [X] Adopt Git flow and delete all the previous spiral branches
  - [X] Create few specific packages (DEB, RPM)
  - [ ] Transition CI/CD scripts to Github actions or TravisCI or something else?
- [X] Mime-type detection and file associations
  - [X] Register file associations with supported document types
  - [X] For now, roll custom mime-type detection system until there is something better available

* Initial plan

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (Open Document, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
- [X] UI and other improvements, including tech debt and other issues
- [X] Bring back Office document support via LibreOffice
  - [X] Add workarounds for mime-type detection library (Open Document, OOXML, Legacy office format)
  - [X] Update processing logic to use LibreOffice for initial PDF conversion, prior further processing
- [X] Documentation updates and compilation error fix
- [X] Usability improvements and slightly better MS Windows support
- [X] Online service with Web interface and remote CLI client
- [X] Look at releases for Linux, Mac OS and Windows
- [X] Documentation updates
- [X] Implement conversion progress information
- [X] Minimal CI/CD pipeline
- [X] Provide live CD
- [X] Initial support for batch conversions
  - [X] In the Web user interface
  - [X] In the graphical desktop interface
  - [X] Document a simple =find-exec= workflow for the command-line client
- [X] Fix few obvious issues and then release new batch conversion feature
  - [X] Do not ship an unsigned app bundle for Mac OS as it doesn't behave/work anyway
  - [X] Mitigate some of the new Desktop and Web UI bugs as much as possible
- [X] Additional release artifacts for convenience
  - [X] Add DMG image for Mac OS, with the ability to still invoke external programs
  - [X] Add software installer for Windows via [[https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page][NSIS]] for now
- [X] Support application preferences
- [X] Add infrastructure for message translations: English and French for now
- [X] Minor code cleanup, create artwork and rename the Github project
