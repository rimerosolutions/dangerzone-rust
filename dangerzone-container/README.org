#+TITLE: dangerzone-container README

* What is this?

This is the =backend/server= part of the solution running inside a container engine ([[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/][Podman]]).


* What is required?

You only need a container engine such as Docker or Podman. Please note that this has only been tested under Linux ([[https://voidlinux.org/][Void Linux]]) with Podman so far.


* How to build this?

At the root of this project, please invoke the command below.

#+begin_src sh
  podman build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

If you use Docker just replace =podman= with =docker= in the above-mentioned command.

* How to run this?

This application is leveraged by the =dangerzone-cli= client (shell commands to =podman= or =docker=) , it's not really meant to be used "directly" except for dev/testing purposes.
