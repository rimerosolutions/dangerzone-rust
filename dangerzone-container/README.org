#+TITLE: dangerzone-container README

* What is this?

This is the =backend/server= part of the solution running inside a container engine ([[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] or [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]]).


* What is required?

You only need a container engine such as Docker or Podman or Lima. Please note that this has only been tested under Linux ([[https://voidlinux.org/][Void Linux]]) with Podman so far.


* How to build this?

The package names vary, but the following dependencies are required under =Void Linux=: =leptonica-devel=, =libclang=, =clang=, =tesseract-ocr-devel=, =poppler-glib-devel=.

At the root of this project, please invoke the command below.

** Podman

#+begin_src sh
  podman build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

** Docker

#+begin_src sh
  docker build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

** Lima

#+begin_src sh
  lima nerdctl build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

* How to run this?

This application is leveraged by the =dangerzone-client= CLI program (shell commands to =podman= or =docker= or =lima=) , it's not really meant to be used "directly" except for dev/testing purposes.
