#+TITLE: RELEASING

General steps:

- Review and update the README page for impacted components as needed
- Bump the version of the application  
  - Bump the =version= field in all the projects (=Cargo.toml= files)
    - The container image tag is inferred from the release version to standardize as much as possible
    - Please try to follow closely [[https://semver.org/][semantic versioning]]
  - Bump the =version= field in the /Dockerfile/ for the label =org.opencontainers.image.version=
- On a recent Ubuntu Linux installation, build all the release artifacts =ci_cd/build_all.sh=
  - This generates all the release artifacts under a new folder called =packages=
  - You can then test the resulting archives and executables under Linux, Mac OS and Windows
  - You can test the live CD ISO image with a tool such as [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] or the software of your choice
- Merge the current branch into the =main= branch, and push the changes
- Tag the main branch with the new =release version= (i.e. =1.1.1=) and push the changes
- Push the container image to [[https://hub.docker.com/r/uycyjnzgntrn/entrusted_container][Docker Hub]] per [[./entrusted_container/README.org][publishing instructions]]
- Create a new release from the GitHub Web interface:
  - Add the release notes
  - Upload all release artifacts (=exe=, =dmg=, =zip=, =tar= and =iso= files)
  - Publish the release
