#+TITLE: cid_cd - support - README

This folder contains container images supporting release builds.

* Goal

The objective is more reproducible builds for enhanced security and better developer experience.

* Assessments

While testing builds for upcoming releases, there can be intermittent failures:
- Often buils are broken for arm64 due to outdated dependencies
- Sometimes Debian Linux packages are broken
- Some new packages versions may introduce compilation errors
- Because there are no base images, there's lots of network chatiness and random network timeouts while downloading packages

* Expected Outcomes

The builds should be faster with a low rate of intermittent build failures (those should be mostly network related).

* Additional References

Please consult the [[./build.sh][build.sh]] script in this directory for more details.
