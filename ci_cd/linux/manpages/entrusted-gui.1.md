DESCRIPTION
===========

The Entrusted GUI program is a graphical aplication that converts
potentially suspicious files to safe PDF documents.

 - You can optionally use optical character recognition (OCR):
  - You need to select text in the PDF
  - You need to be able to perform full-text search in the PDF
 - Most image and Office document formats are supported:
  - Images (.jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .tiff, .png)
  - Documents (spreadsheets, text documents, presentations)

FILES
=====

*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/config.toml*

:   Per-user optional configuration file

ENVIRONMENT
===========
