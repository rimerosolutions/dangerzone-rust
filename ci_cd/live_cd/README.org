#+TITLE: live_cd README

* Overview

The live CD is based on [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] GNU Linux and aims to provide a relatively painless installation of =dangerzone-rust=.
- It's not always that easy for many to install [[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/getting-started/installation][Podman]] (Operating System or User specific issues)
- You may not want to run Docker or Podman directly on your main machine: That translates into running the software inside a virtual machine
  
** Recommended settings

You need at least =1G= of RAM for the Live CD to run correctly:
- There's a correlation between allocated memory and free disk space
- At least ~700MB of free space need to be available for temporary storage between conversions ("conversion sandbox" creation)

By default, the live CD allocates =75%= of the assigned RAM as free disk space.
- The default boot parameters are appended to the grub settings =ramdisk-size=75% overlay-size=75%=.
- The above mentioned values can be changed on startup, when the boot loader menu is showing (=TAB= key)

** User journey

- Download the live CD iso image from the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/releases][GitHub releases page]]
- Boot the live CD iso from the virtualization solution of your choice ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]], [[https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html][VmWare]], etc.)
- Convert your documents via the =dangerzone-rust= online service (Web Interface): =http://ip_of_vm:13000=
  
** Build steps

The steps below have been tested on [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] 11 (/bullseye/) and [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] 22.04 (/jammy/).
- Clone the =dangerzone-rust= git repository from GitHub=rsync=, etc.)
- Run the =build.sh= script in this directory: =chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh=
- The resulting ISO image will be available at =$HOME/LIVE_BOOT/dangerzone-livecd-VERSION_NUMBER.iso=

  The Live CD ISO image size is roughly 1 GB.

* Dangerzone Web UI access

By default, the /Dangerzone Online Service/ is running on port =13000= and binds to all network interfaces (=0.0.0.0=).

You can access it from your machine =http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE:13000=

Please *replace* =IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE= with a valid IP address or hostname, based on your virtual machine network settings.
