#+TITLE: live_cd README

* Overview

The live CD aims to provide a relatively painless installation of =dangerzone-rust=.
- It's not always that easy for many to install Docker or Podman (OS or Linux distro specific issues)
- You may not want to run Docker or Podman directly on your main machine

** User journey

- Download the live CD iso image from the Github releases page
- Boot the live CD iso from the virtualization solution of your choice (QEMU, VirtualBox, etc.)
- Convert your documents via the =dangerzone-rust= online service (Web Interface)
  
** Build steps

The steps below have been tested on Debian 11 (bullseye) and Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy).
- Copy the contents of this folder to the build machine (=git clone=, =rsync=, etc.)
- Run the =build.sh= script in this directory: =chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh=
- The resulting ISO will be available at =$HOME/LIVE_BOOT/dangerzone-livecd-VERSION_NUMBER.iso=

* Dangerzone Web UI access

By default, the /Dangerzone Online Service/ is running on port =13000= and binds to all interfaces (=0.0.0.0=).

You can access it from your machine =http://IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE:13000=

Please *replace* =IP_ADDRESS_OF_VIRTUAL_MACHINE= with a valid IP address or hostname, based on your virtual machine network settings.
