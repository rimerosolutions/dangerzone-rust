#+TITLE: ROADMAP

High-level TODOs:

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral01][spiral01 branch]])
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral02][spiral02 branch]])
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (OpenDocument, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
- [X] UI and other improvements, including tech debt and other issues ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral03][spiral03 branch]])
- [X] Bring back Office document support via LibreOffice ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral04][spiral04 branch]])
  - [X] Add workarounds for mime-type detection library (OpenDocument, OOXML, Legacy office format)
  - [X] Update processing logic to use libreOffice for initial PDF conversion, prior further processing
- [X] Documentation updates and compilation error fix ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral05][spiral05 branch]])
- [X] Usability improvements and slightly better MS Windows support ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral06][spiral06 branch]])
- [X] Online service with Web interface and remote CLI client ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral07][spiral07 branch]])  
- [X] Look at releases for Linux, Mac OS and Windows ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral08][spiral08 branch]])
- [X] Documentation updates ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral09][spiral09 branch]])  
- [X] Implement conversion progress information ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral10][spiral10 branch]])
- [X] Minimal CI/CD pipeline ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral11][spiral11 branch]])
- [X] Provide live CD ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral12][spiral12 branch]])
- [X] Initial support for batch conversions ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral13][spiral13 branch]])
  - [X] In the Web user interface
  - [X] In the graphical desktop interface    
  - [X] Document a simple =find-exec= workflow for the command-line client
- [X] Fix few obvious issues and then release new batch conversion feature ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral14][spiral14 branch]] part 1)
  - [X] Do not ship an unsigned app bundle for Mac OS as it doesn't behave/work anyway
  - [X] Mitigate some of the new Desktop and Web UI bugs as much as possible
- [X] Additional release artifacts for convenience ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral14][spiral14 branch]] part 2)
  - [X] Add DMG image for Mac OS, with the ability to still invoke external programs
  - [X] Add software installer for Windows via [[https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page][NSIS]] for now
- [X] Support application preferences ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral15][spiral15 branch]])
- [ ] Add infrastructure for message translations: errors, UI widgets ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral15][spiral16 branch]])
- [ ] Create artwork and rename the GitHub project
- [ ] Revisit notifications SSE + HTTP2, for the "Online Service"
- [ ] Investigate if specific support is required for Tails Linux
- [ ] Support for password-protected PDF files and maybe other types of documents
- [ ] Transition CI/CD scrips to Github actions or TravisCI or something else?
- [ ] etc.
