#+TITLE: dangerzone-container README

* What is this?

This is the =backend/server= part of the solution running inside a container "solution" ([[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] or [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]]).

There's a small series of transformations leading to the generation of a trusted PDF document (optionally a searchable PDF instead of only images, that is if [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition][OCR]] was requested).
- Most of the conversion steps happen in memory, except for printing office documents to PDF (early stages of the conversion).
- OCR is a resources intensive and time consuming: it should always be disabled, unless you NEED to be able to search or select text in the PDF.

* What is required?

You only need a container engine such as Docker or Podman or Lima. Please note that this has mostly been tested under Linux with Podman so far.

* How to build this?

Please note that the container image of this project is published on [[https://hub.docker.com/r/uycyjnzgntrn/dangerzone-converter][Dockerhub]].

At the root of this project, accordingly your container engine, please invoke one of the commands below.

** Podman

#+begin_src sh
  podman build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

** Docker

#+begin_src sh
  docker build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

** Lima

#+begin_src sh
  lima nerdctl build -t localhost/dangerzone-converter .
#+end_src

For "manual testing" purposes, the following dependencies are required under =Void Linux=: =leptonica-devel=, =libclang=, =clang=, =tesseract-ocr-devel=, =poppler-glib-devel=.

* How to run this?

This application is leveraged by the =dangerzone-client= CLI program (shell commands to =podman= or =docker= or =lima=) , it's not really meant to be used "directly" except for dev/testing purposes.
