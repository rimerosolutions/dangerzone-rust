#+TITLE: DEVNOTES

It is best to build from an Ubuntu virtual machine, especially for the Live CD.
- The Live CD creation has only been tested under Ubuntu (recent versions)
- For other applications (CLI or Desktop GUI), this has been tested few times on popular Linux distributions

* Container images dev testing

In order to discard any environment related issues, it's best to use unique container image names to test new changes.
- Your container solution might attempt to pull latest changes from Docker Hub instead of relying on your newly built image
- You might experience so permission denied error messages that are difficult to assess ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/issues/44][issue 44]])
  
* Application dependencies

  Keeping dependencies minimal can help with both maintenance, build times, security issues and other concerns.
  
* Application packaging

While there are DEB and RPM packages available for convenience, it's best to let package maintainers deal with that
- Conventions for a given Linux distribution are continuously evolving
- It's difficult to satisfy everybody: why isn't there a package for "insert distro of the day here"

The same applies to Mac OS ([[https://brew.sh/][homebrew]], [[https://www.macports.org/][macports]], [[https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-macos/][pkgsrc]], etc.) and Windows ([[https://chocolatey.org/][chocolatey]], [[https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli][winget]], etc.).
