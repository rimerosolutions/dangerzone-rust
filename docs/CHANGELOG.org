#+TITLE: CHANGELOG

* entrusted 0.3.1 (UNRELEASED)

The main objective was to start generating all releases artifacts via the GitHub infrastructure going forward.

- Builds and releases
  - Integrate local shell scripts with [[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub Actions]] workflows
    - Generate of all release artifacts from GitHub (on demand)
    - Publish the "container sandbox" image to [[https://hub.docker.com/][Docker Hub]] (on demand)
    - Scan for container vulnerability in the "container sandbox" image (on demand)
    - Run minimal functional tests (automatically for the development branch)
  - Sync with [[https://github.com/axtloss/flatpaks][axtloss]] for updated =Flatpak= builds on Linux
- Security (Live CD)
  - Implement [[https://gvisor.dev/][gVisor]] as container security platform
  - Harden few services
  - Delete few default system users
- Enhancements
  - Web User Interface: Add tabs to mimic more closely the Desktop version
  - Desktop User Interface: Add hyperlinks for opening directly PDF results
- Maintenance
  - Trim the Live CD image size by roughly 15% (=~800 MB= to =~670 MB=)
    - Boot manager: Replace [[https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/][Grub]] and [[https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=SYSLINUX][SysLinux]] with [[https://limine-bootloader.org/][Limine]]
    - SSH server: Replace [[https://www.openssh.com/][OpenSSH]] with [[https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html][DropBear]]
    - Container solution: Replace the default [[https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=podman&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=stable&section=all][Debian Podman]] version with [[https://github.com/mgoltzsche/podman-static][podman-static]]
    - Linux kernel: Compile custom kernel (=6.0=) for removing unessential modules
  - Address potential conversion failures on the Live CD (disable [[https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc][Hardened malloc]] CPU optimizations)

* entrusted 0.3.0

This release is focused primarily on security concerns, while making reasonable compromises pertaining to usability, user convenience and performance. There are also few user-visible features, on top of the availability of the Live CD for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][aarch64/arm64]].

- Security
  - Implement custom [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/][seccomp]] security profile for "sandbox container execution"
    - This restricts what the application can do inside the container solution
    - This is enabled in the desktop, command-line and Web interfaces
  - Implement security hardening options for the Live CD ([[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html][kernel settings]], [[https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/][hardened_malloc]], [[https://motorscript.com/security-hardening-ssh-linux-server/][SSH]], etc.)
- Bug fixes
  - Address more scenarios that could result into known intermittent conversion failures
- Features:
  - Experimental Live CD availability for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][aarch64/arm64]]
  - Option to cancel conversions that are not yet started
  - Ability to select the PDF result visual quality (=low=, =medium=, =high=)
    - The default value is set to =medium= (same behavior as in =0.2.6=)
    - This can act as a "quick preview" mechanism with "low" settings, followed by a re-conversion
    - Higher visual quality settings impact memory usage, processing time and resulting file size
- Enhancements
  - Allow multiple language selection when creating searchable PDF results ([[https://wiki.beparanoid.de/wiki/Optical_character_recognition?lang=en][OCR]])
  - Set file upload limit to 500 MB for the Web interface (previously relying on unknown defaults...)
  - Improve few visual aspects of the Desktop and Web interfaces
- Maintenance
  - Upgrade software dependencies and cleanup code

* entrusted-0.2.6

- bugfix: Intermittent failures in batch conversions due to container process crashes
- bugfix: Permission denied errors at the end of conversions, under Linux with Docker
- enhancement: More predictable PDF quality and PDF result size
- enhancement: Display overall progress information and final status summary
- enhancement: Add "clickable" hyperlinks in few dialogs (project and release URLs)
- maintenance: Look and feel consistency improvements (Desktop and "Online Service" interfaces)
- maintenance: Web framework change from [[https://actix.rs/][actix_web]] to [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum][axum]] for the "Online Service"
- maintenance: Release pipeline improvements towards more reproducible builds
- documentation: Testing notes with a focus on Linux arm64 testing from amd64 machines

* entrusted-0.2.5

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][aarch64/arm64]] support for Linux and Mac OS, as well as the container image
- Small bug fixes for temporary folders handling
- New button in the Desktop client to manually check for updates

* entrusted-0.2.4

- Hide Microsoft Windows command prompts displayed upon conversion (Issue 7)
- Mitigate false positives while changing file modification dates on Windows (Issue 7)
- Remove UNIX/Linux specific code in the "online service" (entrusted-webserver component)
- Improve user interface "responsiveness" with better decoupling of background tasks

* entrusted-0.2.3

- Provide DEB and RPM packages for convenience (tested on recent Ubuntu and Fedora versions so far)
- Mitigate inability to run the program on Fedora (SELinux related problems with container volumes)
- Address erroneous progress information in early conversions stages
- Fix occasional file deletion bug (select and delete from the conversion queue)

* entrusted-0.2.1

- Mitigate conversion failures for Office documents (errors while exiting container with an exit code 139)
- Allow custom output files in the Desktop GUI client
- Enable conversions of ODG and RTF documents

* entrusted-0.2.0

- Fix long messages truncation bug (Desktop client) resulting into longer conversion times
- Remove read-only container flag for Podman as it occasionally fails conversions
- Add few missing translations and improve code maintenance

* entrusted-0.1.3

- Small bug fixes and performance tweaks
- Visual improvements in the Desktop interface (widgets layout, usability, click bugs, look and feel, etc)
- Mac OS specific updates (Finder "open with", "about" menu)
- CI/CD updates for generating all release artifacts at once, including installers and the live CD

* entrusted-0.1.0

- Batch conversion support
- Minor optimizations and code cleanup
