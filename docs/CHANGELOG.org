#+TITLE: CHANGELOG

* entrusted-0.2.7 (UNRELEASED - Early 2023?)

The next release is focused on security concerns, but there are also few user visible features.

- security: Implement custom [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/][seccomp]] security profile for "sandbox container execution"
  - This restricts what the application can do inside the container solution
  - This enabled by default in the graphical Desktop and command-line interfaces
  - This is enabled by default in the Live CD for the Web interface (not user-visible)
- security: Implement basic harderning for the Live CD ([[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html][kernel settings]], [[https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/][hardened_malloc]], [[https://motorscript.com/security-hardening-ssh-linux-server/][SSH]], etc.)
- bugfix: Address more scenarios that could result into known intermittent conversion failures
- feature: Ability to cancel conversions that are not yet started
- feature: Ability to select PDF result visual quality (=low=, =medium=, =high=)
  - The default value is set to =medium= (same behavior as in =0.2.6=)
  - This can act as a "quick preview" mechanism with "low" settings, followed by a re-conversion
  - Higher visual quality settings impact memory usage, processing time and resulting file size
- enhancement: Set better file upload restrictions in the Web interface (=500 MB= now)    
- enhancement: Allow multiple language selection when creating searchable PDF results ([[https://wiki.beparanoid.de/wiki/Optical_character_recognition?lang=en][OCR]])
- enhancement: Trim container image size for the conversion sandbox (=10%= size reduction)
- enhancement: Improve few visual aspects in the Desktop and Web interfaces
- maintenance: Upgrade software dependencies and cleanup code

* entrusted-0.2.6

- bugfix: Intermittent failures in batch conversions due to container process crashes
- bugfix: Permission denied errors at the end of conversions, under Linux with Docker
- enhancement: More predictable PDF quality and PDF result size
- enhancement: Display overall progress information and final status summary
- enhancement: Add "clickable" hyperlinks in few dialogs (project and release URLs)
- maintenance: Look and feel consistency improvements (Desktop and "Online Service" interfaces)
- maintenance: Web framework change from [[https://actix.rs/][actix_web]] to [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum][axum]] for the "Online Service"
- maintenance: Release pipeline improvements towards more reproducible builds
- documentation: Testing notes with a focus on Linux arm64 testing from amd64 machines

* entrusted-0.2.5

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64][aarch64/arm64]] support for Linux and Mac OS, as well as the container image
- Small bug fixes for temporary folders handling
- New button in the Desktop client to manually check for updates

* entrusted-0.2.4

- Hide Microsoft Windows command prompts displayed upon conversion (Issue 7)
- Mitigate false positives while changing file modification dates on Windows (Issue 7)
- Remove UNIX/Linux specific code in the "online service" (entrusted-webserver component)
- Improve user interface "responsiveness" with better decoupling of background tasks

* entrusted-0.2.3

- Provide DEB and RPM packages for convenience (tested on recent Ubuntu and Fedora versions so far)
- Mitigate inability to run the program on Fedora (SELinux related problems with container volumes)
- Address erroneous progress information in early conversions stages
- Fix occasional file deletion bug (select and delete from the conversion queue)

* entrusted-0.2.1

- Mitigate conversion failures for Office documents (errors while exiting container with an exit code 139)
- Allow custom output files in the Desktop GUI client
- Enable conversions of ODG and RTF documents

* entrusted-0.2.0

- Fix long messages truncation bug (Desktop client) resulting into longer conversion times
- Remove read-only container flag for Podman as it occasionally fails conversions
- Add few missing translations and improve code maintenance

* entrusted-0.1.3

- New application icons and screenshots
- Refactoring of all code references to the previous "Dangerzone" name.
- Minor visual improvements
- Translation fixes and easier maintenance for the underlying abstractions

* entrusted-0.1.2

- Application preferences and translations
- Fix longstanding bug resulting into lack of user feedback (early conversion failures scenario)
- On Windows, provide icons for the dangerzone-client binaries (GUI and CLI programs)
- On Mac OS, make the application launcher script more reliable (app bundle sandbox and external programs)

* entrusted-0.1.1

- Small bug fixes and performance tweaks
- Visual improvements in the Desktop interface (widgets layout, usability, click bugs, look and feel, etc)
- Mac OS specific updates (Finder "open with", "about" menu)
- CI/CD updates for generating all release artifacts at once, including installers and the live CD

* entrusted-0.1.0

- Batch conversion support
- Minor optimizations and code cleanup

* entrusted-0.0.2

- User feedback improvement with conversion progress information
- Minimal speed optimizations
- Experimental Live CD based on Debian "bullseye"

* entrusted-0.0.1

Initial release with support for Linux, Mac OS and Windows
