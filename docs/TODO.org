#+TITLE: TODO

* Milestone: Hardening and features maturity [60%]
- [-] Security
  - [-] [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/][seccomp]] security profile for the conversion sandbox container
    - [ ] This is an opt-in for now, need to just activate it and remove UI settings (if stable enough...)
    - [X] This is activated by default in the Live CD (not a user visible setting)      
  - [X] Virtual machine hardening for Live CD
    - [X] Minimal [[https://docs.arbitrary.ch/security/systemd.html][systemd]] sandboxing for the "Online Service (=entrusted-webserver=), just =PrivateTmp= for now
    - [X] [[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html][sysctl]] settings, kernel boot parameters, [[https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc][hardened_malloc]]
  - [X] Run an publish vulnerability assessments for container images
  - [X] Evaluate more frequently updated container images for CVEs
    - [X] Debian takes a while to sometimes address issues but it's very stable (PREFERRED)
    - [X] Alpine would require revisiting occasional segmentation faults (exit code =139=)
    - [X] Fedora takes a while to build (dnf is VERY slow) and trimming the image size is rather involved
- [X] Improved conversions
  - [X] Review possible  multi-threading issues related with =entrusted-gui=
  - [X] Evaluate performance optimization opportunities
  - [X] Allow multiple language selection for searchable PDFs (OCR)

  - [X] Smaller container image size
  - [X] Sign revision control commits and container images
- [X] Builds and releases
  - [X] +Retry creating a Live CD for =arm64= after many past failures+ (POSTPONED, future)+
    - Too painful to understand what's wrong inside =chroot= (bugs or whatsoever)
    - Impossible to know if the same errors would happen on real hardware vs. emulation ([[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]])      
  - [X] +Revisit migration from local shell scripts to [[https://docs.github.com/en/actions][GitHub actions]] (REJECTED)+
    - Lack of runners for Debian Bullseye (Linux arm64)
    - Random 404 errors with pre-configured APT repositories of some runners
    - Other minor annoyances
  - [X] Ensure that all executables are stripped in the ci/cd pipeline (=strip= command)
  - [X] Bump the cargo edition to =2021= instead of =2018= in cargo manifests
- [X] User interface
  - [X] Few visual improvements in the Desktop and Web interfaces
  - [X] Ability to cancel pending conversion tasks
    - [X] Implementation for the Desktop graphical user interface
    - [X] Implementation for the Web interface
  - [X] PDF result visual quality parameter (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
  - [X] Make PDF result visual quality parameter a checkbox in the Desktop and Web UI (UX consistency)

  - [X] Prompt for confirmation prior closing the application during conversions (Desktop only)
  - [X] Manual check for release updates (Desktop and command-line clients)
- [X] Security
  - [X] Review container execution options (subject of recurring reviews)
  - [X] Review some of the code and read few security-related articles (subject of recurring reviews)

- [X] Mime-type detection and file associations
  - [X] Register file associations with supported document types
  - [X] For now, roll custom mime-type detection system until there is something better available

* Milestone: Initial document sanitization tool [100%]

  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (Open Document, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
