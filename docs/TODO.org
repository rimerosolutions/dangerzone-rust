#+TITLE: TODO

* Milestone: Hardening and features maturity [0%]

- [-] Security
  - [ ] Virtual machine hardening for Live CD
    - [ ] Basic hardening (=Live CD basic edition=) without [[https://gvisor.dev/][gVisor]] as container security platform
    - [ ] [[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html][Extra harderning]] (=Live CD secplus edition=), without [[https://gvisor.dev/][gVisor]] (secure but VERY SLOW). Is this work worth it for most users?
    - Security profiles for the container image execution
      - [ ] AppArmor profile for the container image execution      
      - [ ] seccomp security profile
        - [ ] Use existing [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/][seccomp]] file in Live CD mode and possibly enable it in less controlled environments (=entrusted-gui= or =entrusted-gui=)
        - [ ] Test on =amd64 (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)=
        - [ ] Evaluate opportunities to also make it work for arm64 (previous tests between 0.2.5 and 0.2.6 releases)        
        - [ ] [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:NetSysFire/systemd_sandboxing][Systemd sandboxing]] for the "Online Service (=entrusted-webserver=)      
  - [X] Container image
    - [X] Run an publish vulnerability assessments for container images
    - [X] Evaluate more frequently updated container images for CVEs
      - [X] Going back to Alpine would require revisiting occasional segmentation faults
      - [X] Fedora takes a while to build and trimming the image size is rather involved
      - [X] Debian takes a while to sometimes address issues but it's very stable
  - [ ] Revisit other general security options and practices as part of continuous improvement
  - [ ] Investigate alternate sandbox approaches
- [ ] User interface
  - [ ] Ability to cancel non-started tasks
  - [ ] Evaluate opportunities to simplify the user interface
  - [ ] Additional settings
    - [ ] Paper size and image extract quality (maybe LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH?)
    - [ ] OCR target DPI
    - [ ] Add maybe some kind of profiles or presets? How complex would the UI be?
  - [ ] Smooth scrolling as files are being processed to highlight the current document
- [-] Improved conversions
  - [X] Allow multiple language selection for searchable PDFs (OCR)
  - [ ] Parallel conversions with both user settings and app-managed guardrails
  - [ ] Evaluate performance optimization opportunities
- [-] Builds and releases
  - [ ] Ensure that all executables are stripped in the ci/cd pipeline (=strip= command)    
  - [ ] Better error handling during live CD creation as it can result into an unbootable ISO
  - [ ] Revisit migration from local shell scripts to GitHub actions (or something else)
    - For Github actions, create a YAML workflow file for all required jobs and operating systems
    - [ ] For GitHub actions, the current Mac OS docker image doesn't detect the right rust toolchain
    - [ ] For GitHub actions, need to see if arm64 builds work
    - [ ] For GitHub actions, the Live CD creation should probably be easy enough for amd64
  - [X] Bump the cargo edition to =2021= instead of =2018= in cargo manifests
- [-] Code maintenance
  - [X] Streamline locale handling (=en-CA= detection vs. =en_CA= catalog translation)
  - [ ] Desktop interface code cleanup for clarity and simplicity?
  - [ ] Some level of testing? (scripts at least with exit code capture?)
  - [ ] Use identifiers instead of row indices to enable parallel conversions later (maybe initial "dumb implementation")
