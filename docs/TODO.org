#+TITLE: TODO

* Milestone: From local CI/CD pipelines to GitHub Actions [14%]

- [X] GitHub actions tasks (some of it was already tested/tried)
  - [X] Refactor existing shell scripts to work with GitHub actions and also locally
    - Ability to sustain GitHub outages (those do happen)
    - Flexibility in it's decided to move few things out of GitHub (code and/or CI/CD)
  - [X] Scan for vulnerabilities via a GitHub Actions instead of manual efforts
  - [X] Generate and push container images 
  - [X] Generate Live CD (aarch64 and amd64)
  - [X] Generate main binaries
    - [X] Binaries for Windows (amd64)
    - [X] Binaries for Linux (amd64 and aarch64)
    - [X] Binaries for Mac OS (amd64 and aarch64)
- [ ] See if there's a need to sync with [[https://github.com/axtloss/flatpaks][Axtloss]] for updating the Linux Flatpak (also enquire for arm64)
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] See how to make it easier to test prior releases
  - [ ] Add few encrypted files to existing test data
- [ ] Security
  - [ ] Research how to support additional known security options for the container sandbox execution
  - [ ] Research enabling apparmor on the Live CD
    - Research profile generation    
    - POC tasks required to make it happen
  - [ ] Research enabling gVisor on the Live CD
    - Re-assess performance
    - Re-assesss tasks required to make it happen
- [ ] Conversions
  - [ ] Evaluate level of flexibility for adding other container solutions
- [-] User interface
  - [ ] Evaluate opportunities to simplify the UI without adding too many screens
  - [ ] Desktop interface improvements
    - [ ] Add an "Open" "hyperlink" next to the "Logs" link in the Desktop UI
  - [-] Web interface improvements
    - [X] Add tabs in the Web UI, like in the Desktop UI
    - [ ] Display progress information at the bottom of the page, like in the Desktop UI    
- [ ] Other topics
  - [ ] Revisit Alpine Linux
    - [ ] Review Alpine as container solution like few releases ago
      - This would likely require regenerating the seccomp profile
      - This was slower than Debian during conversions
      - The container image size was tougher to trim than Debian      
    - [ ] Check if it's worth creating a highly tailored CD creation process
      - Existing "kits" produced smaller ISO images than Debian (~600 MB vs ~800 MB)
      - Overlays need to be uncompressed at boot time (slow boot, free disk space, etc.)

* Milestone: Hardening and features maturity [100%]
- [X] Security
  - [X] Limit the attack surface via a custom [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/][seccomp]] security profile for the container image (enabled by default)
    - It is possible to disable it via an environment variable (failsafe if an unexpected bug makes the program unusable)
    - This was achievable via tracing tools ([[https://github.com/containers/oci-seccomp-bpf-hook.git][oci-seccomp-bpf-hook]]), brute-force ([[https://github.com/yveszoundi/seccompian][seccompian]]) and manual tweaks (edge cases)
  - [X] Virtual machine hardening for Live CD
    - [X] Minimal [[https://docs.arbitrary.ch/security/systemd.html][systemd]] sandboxing for the "Online Service (=entrusted-webserver=)
    - [X] [[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html][sysctl]] settings, kernel boot parameters, [[https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc][hardened_malloc]]
  - [X] Run an publish vulnerability assessments for container images
  - [X] Evaluate more frequently updated container images for CVEs
    - [X] Debian takes a while to sometimes address issues but it's very stable (PREFERRED)
    - [X] Alpine is the best "safe by default" option, with few compromises (REASONABLE)
      - CVEs are addressed very quickly, in fact close to none detected by [[https://trivy.dev/][Trivy]]
      - It seems to require more system calls with =musl=, impacting benefits of fine-grained =seccomp= profiles
      - It is easier on computer resources, but noticeably slower on "medium size" documents (i.e. 100+ PDF pages)      
    - [X] Fedora takes a while to build (dnf is VERY slow) and trimming the image size is rather involved
- [X] Improved conversions
  - [X] Review possible  multi-threading issues related with =entrusted-gui=
  - [X] Evaluate performance optimization opportunities

  - [X] Smaller container image size
  - [X] Sign revision control commits
- [X] Builds and releases
  - [X] Experimental Live CD for =arm64/aarch64= (tested via [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] emulation)
  - [X] +Revisit migration from local shell scripts to [[https://docs.github.com/en/actions][GitHub actions]] (NEXT ITERATION)+
    - Lack of control around runners and their availability without further work (Linux =arm64=, specific/fixed distro versions)
    - Random 404 errors with pre-configured APT repositories (Azure ubuntu repositories, etc.)
    - Lack of investigation for the Live CD creation in =chroot=
  - [X] Ensure that all executables are stripped in the ci/cd pipeline (=strip= command)
  - [X] Bump the cargo edition to =2021= instead of =2018= in cargo manifests
- [X] User interface
  - [X] Few visual improvements in the Desktop and Web interfaces
  - [X] Ability to cancel pending conversion tasks (Desktop GUI and Web interfaces)
  - [X] PDF result visual quality parameter (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
  - [X] Make PDF result visual quality parameter a checkbox in the Desktop and Web UI (UX consistency)

    - [X] Determine and document schedule
    - [X] Revisit currently used/preferred tool ([[https://trivy.dev/][Trivy]])
- [X] Code maintenance

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (Open Document, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
