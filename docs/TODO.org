#+TITLE: TODO

* Milestone: Hardening and features maturity [100%]
- [X] Security
  - [X] Limit the attack surface via a custom [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/][seccomp]] security profile for the container image (enabled by default)
    - It is possible to disable it via an environment variable (failsafe if an unexpected bug makes the program unusable)
    - This was achievable via tracing tools ([[https://github.com/containers/oci-seccomp-bpf-hook.git][oci-seccomp-bpf-hook]]), brute-force ([[https://github.com/yveszoundi/seccompian][seccompian]]) and manual tweaks (edge cases)
  - [X] Virtual machine hardening for Live CD
    - [X] Minimal [[https://docs.arbitrary.ch/security/systemd.html][systemd]] sandboxing for the "Online Service (=entrusted-webserver=)
    - [X] [[https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html][sysctl]] settings, kernel boot parameters, [[https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc][hardened_malloc]]
  - [X] Run an publish vulnerability assessments for container images
  - [X] Evaluate more frequently updated container images for CVEs
    - [X] Debian takes a while to sometimes address issues but it's very stable (PREFERRED)
    - [X] Alpine is the best "safe by default" option, with few compromises (REASONABLE)
      - CVEs are addressed very quickly, in fact close to none detected by [[https://trivy.dev/][Trivy]]
      - It seems to require more system calls with =musl=, impacting benefits of fine-grained =seccomp= profiles
      - It is easier on computer resources, but noticeably slower on "medium size" documents (i.e. 100+ PDF pages)      
    - [X] Fedora takes a while to build (dnf is VERY slow) and trimming the image size is rather involved
- [X] Improved conversions
  - [X] Review possible  multi-threading issues related with =entrusted-gui=
  - [X] Evaluate performance optimization opportunities
  - [X] Allow multiple language selection for searchable PDFs (OCR)
- [X] Code maintenance and other practices
  - [X] Happy path integration testing with [[https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber][cucumber-rs]] (=entrusted_client=) 
  - [X] Review command-line flags default values after upgrading command-line arguments library
  - [X] Apply most of [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy][clippy]] suggested code changes (linting)
  - [X] Streamline locale handling (=en-CA= detection vs. =en_CA= catalog translation)
  - [X] Smaller container image size
  - [X] Sign revision control commits
- [X] Builds and releases
  - [X] Experimental Live CD for =arm64/aarch64= (tested via [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]] emulation)
  - [X] +Revisit migration from local shell scripts to [[https://docs.github.com/en/actions][GitHub actions]] (NEXT ITERATION)+
    - Lack of control around runners and their availability without further work (Linux =arm64=, specific/fixed distro versions)
    - Random 404 errors with pre-configured APT repositories (Azure ubuntu repositories, etc.)
    - Lack of investigation for the Live CD creation in =chroot=
  - [X] Ensure that all executables are stripped in the ci/cd pipeline (=strip= command)
  - [X] Bump the cargo edition to =2021= instead of =2018= in cargo manifests
- [X] User interface
  - [X] Few visual improvements in the Desktop and Web interfaces
  - [X] Ability to cancel pending conversion tasks (Desktop GUI and Web interfaces)
  - [X] PDF result visual quality parameter (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
  - [X] Make PDF result visual quality parameter a checkbox in the Desktop and Web UI (UX consistency)

* Milestone: Usability and features stabilization [100%]

  - [X] Responsiveness issues during conversions (UI thread and background operations)
  - [X] Display overall conversion results ("X out of Y files were not successfully converted")
  - [X] Prompt for confirmation prior closing the application during conversions (Desktop only)
  - [X] Manual check for release updates (Desktop and command-line clients)
- [X] Security
  - [X] Review container execution options (subject of recurring reviews)
  - [X] Review some of the code and read few security-related articles (subject of recurring reviews)
  - [X] Document periodic container vulnerability assessments (new =org-mode= file)
    - [X] Determine and document schedule
    - [X] Revisit currently used/preferred tool ([[https://trivy.dev/][Trivy]])
- [X] Code maintenance
  - [X] Migrate from [[https://actix.rs/][actix_web]] to [[https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum][axum]] for the =entrusted_webserver= component
  - [X] Eliminate shell commands inside the container image
  - [X] Investigate why Firefox now blocks programmatic button clicks for file uploads? (missing =xdg-portal*= packages for [[https://snapcraft.io/about][snap]])

  - [X] For now, stick to custom CI/CD pipeline instead of [[https://github.com/features/actions][GitHub actions]] or similar
- [X] Mime-type detection and file associations
  - [X] Register file associations with supported document types
  - [X] For now, roll custom mime-type detection system until there is something better available

  - [X] Move some documentation to [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/wiki][wiki pages]]
  - [X] Publish presentations
    - [X] [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/files/9892585/entrusted_document_sanitizer.pdf][PDF slides]]
    - [X] [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InEsPLyFsKQ][Youtube presentation]]

* Milestone: Initial document sanitization tool [100%]

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (Open Document, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
