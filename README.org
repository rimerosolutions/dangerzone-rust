#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

This repository will explore (*possibly*) other approaches for [[https://dangerzone.rocks/][Dangerzone]], a tool built by [[https://github.com/micahflee][Michah Lee]].
- The code will be maintained more or less like a *lightweight course*(??), via different Git branches (See /Envisioned Roadmap/ section).
- I intend to deploy the code as a service on my home network at some point in time (old laptop or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi][Raspberry Pi]] maybe)

Dangerzone allows converting suspiciuous documents (images, office, pdfs) into safe and trusted PDFs, without worrying too much about viruses or evil macros.

* Why this?

- *Personal learning*: [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] is reasonably high-level and is not garbage collected.
- *Self-Contained tooling with no scripting*: As much as possible there should be no scripting, including running external programs (except for the frontend).
- *Workflow automation exploration*: Browser plugin, VM orchestration, Web Service, etc.
- *Optimization opportunities*: Reduced container image size with very low computer resources requirements.

* Screenshots

** Desktop User Interface

The initial desktop user interface running on MacOS Big Sur.

** Command-Line User Interface

The command-line interface running on Void Linux.

* What is planned?

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral01][spiral01 branch]])
- [X] "Misc." bulk changes
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (OpenDocument, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
- [ ] UI and other improvements, including tech debt and other issues
- [ ] Investigate problems with creating Rust binaries with 100% static linking
- [ ] Improved MacOS support ([[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]], additional notes for [[https://github.com/containers/podman][Podman]] current volume limitations, etc.) 
- [ ] Look at automation scenarios and use-cases (Browser plugin, Http Proxy, etc.)
- [ ] Etc.
