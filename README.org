#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

This repository will explore (*possibly*) other approaches for [[https://dangerzone.rocks/][Dangerzone]], a tool built by [[https://github.com/micahflee][Michah Lee]].

Dangerzone allows converting suspiciuous documents (images, office, pdfs) into safe and trusted PDFs, without worrying too much about viruses or evil macros.

* Why this?

- *Personal learning*: [[Ëœhttps://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] is reasonably high-level and is not garbage collected.
- *Self-Contained tooling with no scripting*: As much as possible there should be no scripting, including running external programs (except for the frontend).
- *Workflow automation*: Browser plugin, VM orchestration, Web Service, etc.
- *Optimization opportunities*: Reduced container image size with very low computer resources requirements.


* Envisioned Roadmap

This will be developed with an incremental spiral approach (different git branches):

- [ ] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior
- [ ] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
- [ ] Add additional interfaces (Desktop, Web)
- [ ] Look at automation scenarios
- [ ] Etc.
