#+TITLE: entrusted README

* What is this?

** Overview

=Entrusted= is a document sanitizer tool that converts "/potentially suspicious files/" into /safe PDFs/:
- This is achieved by processing documents inside a "lightweight sandbox" ([[https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containerization][containerization]])
- PDF documents, common image formats and Office documents ([[https://www.office.com/][MS Office]] or [[https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/what-is-opendocument/][OpenDocument]]) are supported

Unless you use the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/tree/main/ci_cd/live_cd][live CD]], you *MUST* install either [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/getting-started/][Podman]] prior running the program

** Features

Key features include the following:
- Files (PDF, Office documents and images) are processed inside a "sandbox"
- The transformation of huge documents is frictionless
- Files can be converted in batch
- An optional Web interface is available and can act as an "online service"
- The [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/entrusted/tree/main/ci_cd/live_cd][live CD]] provides both enhanced security and configuration convenience
- The application has multilingual support (English and French for now)
- Password-protected files are supported (known Office document formats and PDF files)
- On Mac OS, [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]] can be installed as an alternative to [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker]] (/default Lima instance/ only)

** Use-cases

Do you identify yourself in one the situations below?
- I think that my computer might have been infected few times due to documents containing malware
- I "acquire" lots of documents from file sharing applications such as Bittorrent
- I often need to open email attachments from unknown senders
- I download lots of files from "potentially non-trusted websites", those sites look legit though

** Supported files

The following file types can be processed with =Entrusted=:
- Images (=.jpg=, =.jpeg=, =.gif=, =.png=, =.tif=, =.tiff=)
- Document Graphics (=.odg=)
- Text Documents (=.rtf=, =.doc=, =.docx=, =.odt=)
- Spreadsheets (=.xls=, =.xlsx=, =.ods=)
- Presentations (=.ppt=, =.pptx=, =.odp=)
    
* What is available?

** User interfaces

There are three user interfaces ([[./app/entrusted_client][Desktop and CLI]], [[./app/entrusted_webserver][Web]]):
- The graphical Desktop interface is recommended for most users
- If you prefer the Web interface, please download the live CD for an out-of-the-box user experience:
  - You can run the live CD with tools such as [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v][Hyper-V]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VmWare]], [[https://www.parallels.com/][Parallels]], etc.
  - The Web UI can be accessed at the address =http://localhost:13000=
  - Replace =localhost= by the IP address of your virtual machine in the above-mentioned link

* What is required?

It is assumed that you can allocate at least 1 GB of memory for document processing.
- Operating System: Linux, Mac OS or Windows
- Container Runtime: [[https://podman.io/][Podman]] (Linux), [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] (Linux, Mac OS, Windows) or [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]] (Mac OS)

Conversions will fail if the container solution is not running or available in your [[https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html]["PATH settings"]]:
  - The tool doesn't attempt to modify software on your machine (install or change programs)
  - The tool doesn't attempt to manage software on your machine (start or stop services)
