#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

This repository will explore (*possibly*) other approaches for [[https://dangerzone.rocks/][Dangerzone]], a tool built by [[https://github.com/micahflee][Michah Lee]].
- The code will be maintained more or less like a *lightweight course*, via different Git branches (See /Envisioned Roadmap/ section).
- I intend to deploy the code as a service on my home network at some point in time (old laptop or a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi][Raspberry Pi]] maybe)

Dangerzone allows converting suspiciuous documents (images, office, pdfs) into safe and trusted PDFs, without worrying too much about viruses or evil macros.

* Why this?

- *Personal learning*: [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] is reasonably high-level and is not garbage collected.
- *Self-Contained tooling with no scripting*: As much as possible there should be no scripting, including running external programs (except for the frontend).
- *Workflow automation exploration*: Browser plugin, VM orchestration, Web Service, etc.
- *Optimization opportunities*: Reduced container image size with very low computer resources requirements.


* Envisioned Roadmap

This will be developed with an incremental spiral approach (different git branches):

- [ ] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral01][spiral01 branch]])
- [ ] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
- [ ] Add additional interfaces (Desktop, Web)
- [ ] Look at automation scenarios
- [ ] Etc.
