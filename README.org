#+TITLE: README

* What is this?

Dangerzone allows converting suspiciuous documents into safe and trusted PDFs, without worrying too much about viruses or evil macros.
- This repository is a [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] port of [[https://dangerzone.rocks/][Dangerzone]], for experimentation purposes
- Similarly to the original Dangerzone tool, documents or images are converted inside a "sandbox"

Below is a high-level architecture overview.

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux and MacOS haven been tested
  - Windows and BSD support will be tested soon enough
  - Under BSD, the UI is likely not available due to technical challenges (FTLK UI compilation)
- *Container Runtime*: [[https://podman.io/][Podman]], [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]]
  - For MacOS, /please/ use either Docker or Lima, as Podman on MacOS has [[https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/8016][annoyances]] for volumes
  - The program doesn't auto-configure remote mounts (i.e. [[https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-machine.1.html][Podman machine]] or [[https://multipass.run/docs][Multipass]])

* Why this?

- *Personal learning*: [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] is reasonably high-level and is not garbage collected
- *Self-Contained tooling with no scripting*
- *Workflow automation exploration*: Browser plugin, VM orchestration, Web Service, etc.
- *Optimization opportunities*: Reduced container image size with very low computer resources requirements

* What does it look like?

** Desktop User Interface

The initial desktop user interface running on MacOS Monterey.

** Command-Line User Interface

ËœThe command-line interface running on Void Linux.

* What is planned?

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral01][spiral01 branch]])
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral02][spiral02 branch]])
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (OpenDocument, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
- [X] UI and other improvements, including tech debt and other issues ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral03][spiral03 branch]])
- [X] Bring back Office document support via LibreOffice ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral04][spiral04 branch]])
  - [X] Add workarounds for mime-type detection library (OpenDocument, OOXML, Legacy office format)
  - [X] Update processing logic to use libreoffice for initial PDF conversion, prior further processing
- [X] Documentation updates and compilation error fix ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral05][spiral05 branch]])
- [ ] Revisit replacement of LibreOffice command-line invocation with Java native code  
- [ ] Revisit remote mounts options for [[https://github.com/canonical/multipass][Multipass]] and [[https://github.com/containers/podman][Podman]]
- [ ] Investigate if it's possible to build the GUI under BSD systems
- [ ] Look at releases for Linux, MacOS and Windows; CLI-only client for BSD systems?
- [ ] Look at automation scenarios and use-cases (Browser plugin, HTTP Proxy, etc.)
- [ ] Investigate container runtime support for BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD & NetBSD): jails and similar options?
- [ ] TBD
