#+TITLE: README

This is work in progress and this NOT a mature project.

* What is this?

** Overview

=dangerzone-rust= allows converting "/potentially suspicious documents/" into safe and trusted PDFs, without worrying too much about viruses or evil macros.
- This is achieved by transforming documents inside a "lightweight sandbox" ([[https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/containerization][containerization]]): =containerization= itself does not provide absolute security guarantees...
- Supported file formats include PDF, common image formats, Office documents ([[https://www.office.com/][Microsoft Office]] or [[https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/what-is-opendocument/][OpenDocument]]). For Office documents, supported is limited to text documents, spreadsheets and presentations.

*NOTE*: Unless you use the live CD, you MUST install either [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker]] or [[https://podman.io/getting-started/][Podman]] prior running the program.

** Features

This repository is a [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] port of [[https://dangerzone.rocks/][Dangerzone]], for experimentation purposes (/not an exact port/).
- Similarly to the original Dangerzone tool, documents or images are converted inside a "sandbox"
- On top of basic features, additional functionality include:
  - Support for batch conversions
  - Optional Web interface that can act as an "online service" (multi-tenancy)
  - Transparent support for large files (timeouts or other issues)
  - Live CD user experience for both enhanced security and convenience (=http://machine_ip:13000=):
    - Extra isolation while running inside a virtual machine
    - Pre-installed [[https://xebia.com/blog/podman-the-free-container-engine-alternative-to-docker/][container solution]] with no required user configuration ([[./dangerzone_httpserver][dangerzone_httpserver]])
  - [[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/][Docker]] dependency alternative on Mac OS, via [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]]
    
* What is available?

** User interfaces

There are 3 user interfaces ([[./dangerzone_client][Desktop and CLI]], [[./dangerzone_httpserver][Web]])
- Most users will likely want the Desktop version
- If you prefer the Web interface, please download the live CD ISO for an "out of the box non-involved user experience" (/unless you'd rather setup the Web server yourself/):
  - You can run the live CD with tools such as [[https://www.qemu.org/][QEMU]], [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v][Hyper-V]], [[https://www.vmware.com/nl/products/workstation-player.html][VmWare]], [[https://www.parallels.com/][Parallels]], etc.
  - The Web UI is available at =http://localhost:13000=
  - Replace =localhost= by the IP address of your virtual machine in the above-mentioned link

** Key components

Most users will open a document with the =dangerzone-client=, this will automatically install the =dangerzone-container= (on demand) and generate a PDF.

|-----------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| Component             | Purpose                                     |
|-----------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| [[./dangerzone_container][dangerzone_container]]  | Document processing "sandbox"                |
| [[./dangerzone_client][dangerzone_client]]     | Command-line and graphical user interfaces  |
| [[./dangerzone_httpserver][dangerzone_httpserver]] | Online service feature with a Web interface |
| [[./dangerzone_httpclient][dangerzone_httpclient]] | Command-line client for the online service  |
|-----------------------+---------------------------------------------|

** Architecture overview

Below is a high-level architecture overview, the solution relies on a container engine solution (i.e. [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]]).

* What is required?

- *Operating System*: Linux, Mac OS or Windows
  - Mostly Linux has been tested
  - BSD users can probably use the "Online service" and its Web interface
- *Container Runtime*: [[https://podman.io/][Podman]], [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]]
  - On Linux, please install Podman
  - For Windows, Docker is recommended
  - For Mac OS, /please/ use either Docker or Lima

The tool will prompt you if it cannot find a container runtime.
  - It doesn't attempt to install the container runtime itself
  - It doesn't attempt to start/stop/monitor the container runtime itself

* What is planned?

- [X] Replicate CLI functions of the original tool, not necessarily the exact behavior ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral01][spiral01 branch]])
- [X] "Misc." bulk fixes & changes ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral02][spiral02 branch]])
  - [X] Eliminate CLI calls inside the container, most of the job can likely be done with libraries
  - [X] Minimal Desktop user interface via the [[https://github.com/fltk-rs/fltk-rs][FLTK]] lightweight toolkit
  - [X] Temporarily drop support for Office documents (OpenDocument, MS Office), more research for [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/rust-calls-java][Java native libraries integration]] (few runtime errors with [[https://www.oracle.com/java/graalvm/][GraalVM]])
- [X] UI and other improvements, including tech debt and other issues ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral03][spiral03 branch]])
- [X] Bring back Office document support via LibreOffice ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral04][spiral04 branch]])
  - [X] Add workarounds for mime-type detection library (OpenDocument, OOXML, Legacy office format)
  - [X] Update processing logic to use libreOffice for initial PDF conversion, prior further processing
- [X] Documentation updates and compilation error fix ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral05][spiral05 branch]])
- [X] Usability improvements and slightly better MS Windows support ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral06][spiral06 branch]])
- [X] Online service with Web interface and remote CLI client ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral07][spiral07 branch]])  
- [X] Look at releases for Linux, Mac OS and Windows ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral08][spiral08 branch]])
- [X] Documentation updates ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral09][spiral09 branch]])  
- [X] Implement conversion progress information ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral10][spiral10 branch]])
- [X] Minimal CI/CD pipeline ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral11][spiral11 branch]])
- [X] Provide live CD ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral12][spiral12 branch]])
- [X] Initial support for batch conversions ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral13][spiral13 branch]])
  - [X] In the Web user interface
  - [X] In the graphical desktop interface    
  - [X] Document a simple =find-exec= workflow for the command-line client
- [X] Fix few obvious issues and then release new batch conversion feature ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral14][spiral14 branch]] part 1)
  - [X] Do not ship an unsigned app bundle for Mac OS as it doesn't behave/work anyway
  - [X] Mitigate some of the new Desktop and Web UI bugs as much as possible
- [X] Additional release artifacts for convenience ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral14][spiral14 branch]] part 2)
  - [X] Add DMG installer for Mac OS, with app ability to still invoke external programs
  - [X] Add MSI installer for Windows via [[https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page][NSIS]] for now
- [X] Support application preferences ([[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/dangerzone-rust/tree/spiral15][spiral15 branch]])
- [ ] Support translations
- [ ] Create artwork and rename the GitHub project
- [ ] Revisit notifications SSE + HTTP2, for the "Online Service"
- [ ] Investigate if specific support is required for Tails Linux
- [ ] Support for password-protected PDF files and maybe other types of documents
- [ ] Transition CI/CD scrips to Github actions or TravisCI or something else?
- [ ] etc.  
    
* What are the differences with Dangerzone?

This project is more of a hobby at this point: it lacks testing, maturity and several features.

** The good

|------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic                                    | Details                                                         |
|------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Likely faster processing*               | Programming language difference and "1-step" conversion process |
| *Online service*                         | HTTP server with a minimal lightweight Web interface            |
| *Docker alternative on Mac OS*           | [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][Lima]] was tested (Only support for "default instance")           |
| *Less likelihood of conversion timeouts* | There's only one external program involved (=LibreOffice=)      |
|------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
  
** The ugly

|------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic                                    | Details                                                   |
|------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| *Likely less secure than the dangerzone* | 1 step conversion process, instead of 2 steps             |
| *This is mostly an experiment*           | Not heavily tested, even if I use =dangerzone-rust= daily |
| *Not the best code*                      | I barely /know/ =Rust=, in comparison to =Java=           |
| *No support for translations yet*        | I have done a minimal POC for the approach                |
| *Incomplete*                             | UI &code polishing, probably several "obvious things"     |
