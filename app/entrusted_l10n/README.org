* What is this?

This is a helper library for translated content (localization support functions):
- It leverages [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/][GNU Gettext]] for translations in Rust
- It abstracts the underlying GNU Gettext ecosystem from the rest of the components

* Why GNU Gettext?

GNU Gettext is not necessarily the "best thing out there", but:
- It is easy to understand
- It is fairly well documented
- It has a decent set of features
- It has tooling support for both developers and translators
- It provides a familiar feel to many Open Source developers  

* What is required?

The usual [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html][Rust toolchain]] (=1.70+=) is needed for builds. The code itself is used from other modules (=entrusted_container=, =entrusted_client=, =entrusted_webserver=, =entrusted_webclient=).

* How to build this?

The library is built automatically from dependent projects. You can still compile this separately by running =cargo build= from this folder.

* How to add new translations?

** Tooling

There are [[https://www.gnu.org/software/trans-coord/manual/web-trans/html_node/PO-Editors.html][few popular tools]] for editing /GNU Gettext/ files, aside from plain text editors.

Other software include, but is not limited to the following:
- [[https://virtaal.translatehouse.org/][Virtaal]]
- [[https://pootle.translatehouse.org/][Pootle]]
- [[https://docs.weblate.org/no/latest/devel/gettext.html][Weblate]]
  
** Installing translations

For all application modules leveraging this library, there's a =translations= folder containing relevant =GNU Gettext po files=.

The relevant sub-folders for translation follow [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes][ISO_639 conventions]]:
- By default, there's always an =en= folder for English
- For targetting specifically =Canadian English=, there would be an =en_CA= directory (TODO normalize =en-CA= vs =en_CA=...)

You don't need to provide compiled =GNU Gettext mo files=:
- Those are automatically generated at build time (i.e. =build.rs= file of other projects)
- The translations are embedded into software executable binaries upon successful builds
