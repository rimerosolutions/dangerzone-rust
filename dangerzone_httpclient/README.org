#+TITLE: dangerzone-httpclient README

* What is this?

This repository provides a command-line client for the =dangerzone-httpserver= component. It also acts a concrete tutorial of the =dangerzone-httpserver= API usage.

There are few reasons to run the =dangerzone-httpclient= binary:
- You opted to install the =dangerzone-httpserver= instead of the default clients (GUI or CLI)
- You do not want your Web browser to use more resources (Nowadays, most browsers require ~1GB of RAM just with few tabs open!)
- Occasionally you want to run automation scripts ([[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12902/how-to-run-find-exec][find and exec]]).
  - This can be use for recursive conversions
  - This can supplement existing workflows driven from shell scripts

* How does it works?

The client invokes the =dangerzone-httpserver= Web API and processes notifications from [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events][SSE events]].

* What does it look like?

In the screenshot below, the client is running in an Ubuntu Linux VM and the server is running inside a Debian Linux VM.

* How to build this?

At the root of this project, open a command prompt and type =cargo build=.*

* How to run this?

The =dangerzone-httpclient= binary is similar to the =dangerzone-cli= except that it interacts with a Web API.
